# Running Thief Problem

This problem is about a thief, that has to rob a set of houses in different streets. <br>
He has a backpack that is capable of a specified amount of loot and should get the most in the shortest time (way).<br>
We used Dijkstra to measure the distance between a house and the end house. Then an algorithm builds a value that represents worth/weight/distance. <br>
This algorithm takes the best route and builds our path from house to house.
